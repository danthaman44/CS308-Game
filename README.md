CS308 Game Plan
Dan Deng

My game will be an non-shooting top down scroller implementation of the game “Fix-it Felix Jr.” from the Disney Movie “Wreck-it Ralph” (basically “Toy Story” with arcade game characters). The setting of the game will be a tall building. Wreck-it-Ralph will be at the top, throwing bricks down at Fix-it Felix Jr. Felix will need to avoid these bricks and advance up the building. If Felix is hit three times by a brick, the game is over. Once Felix makes it to the top of the building, the player wins. If I have extra time, I will add a feature where Felix can use his fix-it hammer to fix broken windows on his way up for additional points. There will most likely not be any gravity acting on the player in the game.

This game will be mostly based off of the engine and graphics supplied by the demo game in JGame. Instead of controlling a spaceship that can only move left and right, the player will control a Felix sprite, who can move in all four directions. The player will use the arrow keys to move Felix. The player will press z to use a hammer to fix windows. At the top of the building, a Ralph sprite will move side to side throwing bricks at Felix. The bricks will take the place of the circular white blobs in the sample game that do damage to the player. There will be two levels, a beginner level and a hard level. In the hard level, Ralph will throw more bricks, and they will come down faster. Felix will also only have one life. There will be a numeric cheat code the user can type at any point during either level that will make Felix impervious to damage from Ralph's bricks.

The player will get 50 points for completing the easy level, and 100 for completing the hard level. Additional points can be earned by fixing windows. The game will have a splash screen that allows the user to choose the level. If I have time, I will have the splash screen play music.
